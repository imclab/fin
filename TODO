=== P1 ====

Support updating list views
	Local: uses array property. UI can change order
	Gloabl (implicit order): uses couchdb views with sort order. UI cannot change order directly. Uses changes API with a filter
	Global (explicit order): uses couchdb views over a specific property to give order. Uses changes API with a filter

=== P2 ====

Database: Remove the nested properties object - should just be reading directly off of the document

Property chaining depends alot on recursive calls modifying the property chain, which requires a bunch of dependancyChain.slice(0) copying of the dependancy chain array. Should use loops instead, without modifying the propertyChain




=== P3 ====

Look over API again - would be nice to have something like fin.applyToElement

Create ListDragNDrop view for drag and drop support to lists
