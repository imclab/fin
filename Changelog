v0.2.0
+ first version of fin models! Yay ORM
+ Use latest version 0.1.5 of browser-require
+ Changes to client-side api:
	- Change list operation names: "append" and "prepend" are now "push" and "unshift"
	- API methods can now take arrays as property names in addition to dotted string, e.g. "user.name" == ['user','name']
	- The local and global IDs are now 0 and -1 respectively, rather than "GLOBAL" and "LOCAL".
	- Added a bunch of runtime checks to assure that IDs are always numeric

v0.1.1
+ Use latest version 0.1.3 of browser-require
+ Allow for chaining "on" of the server-side fin API - fin.on(...).on(...)

v0.1.0
+ First versioned version of fin
+ There are two APIs: api/client.js and api/server.js
+ Engines are completely decoupled and split between pubsub and storage
+ Redis and development (node in-memory) engines exist for pubsub and storage
